Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
1. Git allow saving multiple files in one commit so that all the changes in multiple interrelated files will be commited together and there will not be any mismatch.
2. in google docs, only changed file is commited.
